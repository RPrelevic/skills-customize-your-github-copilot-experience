# Git Commit and Push Changes
Your goal is to stage, commit, and push recent changes to the GitHub repository.

## Step 1: Stage Changes
Use `git add .` to stage all modified and new files for commit.

## Step 2: Commit Changes
Create a commit with a meaningful message summarizing the changes made. Inspect the recent changes to determine an appropriate commit message.
Use listing and bulleted format to clearly outline the changes in the commit message.

## Step 3: Push Changes
Push the committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub using `git push`.
